The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

At the GM's discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t",components:["material","somatic","verbal"]}],t={};function a(e,t){for(var a=0;a<t.length;a++){var n=t[a];n.enumerable=n.enumerable||!1,n.configurable=!0,"value"in n&&(n.writable=!0),Object.defineProperty(e,n.key,n)}}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.default=void 0;var n="SpellDB_bookmarkLists",o="SpellDB_activeList";function r(){return"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".replace(/[xy]/g,function(e){var t=16*Math.random()|0;return("x"==e?t:3&t|8).toString(16)})}var i=function(){function e(){(function(e,t){if(!(e instanceof t))throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function")})(this,e),this.events={dataUpdate:"spelllists-dataupdate",activeListUpdate:"spelllists-activelistupdate"},this.bookmarkLists=null;try{this.bookmarkLists=JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(n))}catch(e){this.bookmarkLists=null}this.bookmarkLists&&Array.isArray(this.bookmarkLists)||(this.bookmarkLists=[{id:r(),name:"Default",spells:{},spellCount:0}]),this.activeList=window.localStorage.getItem(o),(!this.activeList||this.activeList>=this.bookmarkLists.length)&&(this.activeList=0);var t={};this.on=function(e,a){t[e]||(t[e]=[]),t[e].push(a)},this.off=function(e,a){if(t[e])for(var n=0;n<t[e].length;n++)t[e][n]===a&&t[e].splice(n,1)},this.emit=function(e,a){t[e]&&t[e].forEach(function(t){return t(e,a)})},this.saveLists=function(){window.localStorage.setItem(n,JSON.stringify(this.bookmarkLists)),this.emit(this.events.dataUpdate,this.getBookmarkLists())}.bind(this),this.saveActiveList=function(){window.localStorage.setItem(o,this.activeList),this.emit(this.events.activeListUpdate,this.getActiveBookmarkList())}.bind(this)}return function(e,t,n){t&&a(e.prototype,t),n&&a(e,n)}(e,[{key:"setActiveList",value:function(e){var t=this.getIndexFromId(e);-1!=t&&(this.activeList=t,this.saveActiveList())}},{key:"newList",value:function(){this.bookmarkLists.push({id:r(),name:"",spells:{},spellCount:0}),this.saveLists()}},{key:"updateListName",value:function(e,t){var a=this.getIndexFromId(e);-1!=a&&(this.bookmarkLists[a].name=t),this.saveLists()}},{key:"deleteList",value:function(e){if(this.bookmarkLists.length>1){var t=this.getIndexFromId(e);-1!=t&&(this.bookmarkLists.splice(t,1),this.activeList==t&&(this.activeList--,this.saveActiveList()),this.saveLists())}}},{key:"getIndexFromId",value:function(e){for(var t=0;t<this.bookmarkLists.length;t++)if(this.bookmarkLists[t].id==e)return t;return-1}},{key:"toggleSpell",value:function(e){-1!=this.activeList&&(this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList].spells[e]?(delete this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList].spells[e],this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList].spellCount--):(this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList].spells[e]=!0,this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList].spellCount++),this.saveLists())}},{key:"getBookmarkLists",value:function(){return this.bookmarkLists}},{key:"getActiveBookmarkList",value:function(){return this.bookmarkLists[this.activeList]}}]),e}();t.default=i;var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols,l=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,c=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var u=function(){try{if(!Object.assign)return!1;var e=new String("abc");if(e[5]="de","5"===Object.getOwnPropertyNames(e)[0])return!1;for(var t={},a=0;a<10;a++)t["_"+String.fromCharCode(a)]=a;if("0123456789"!==Object.getOwnPropertyNames(t).map(function(e){return t[e]}).join(""))return!1;var n={};return"abcdefghijklmnopqrst".split("").forEach(function(e){n[e]=e}),"abcdefghijklmnopqrst"===Object.keys(Object.assign({},n)).join("")}catch(e){return!1}}()?Object.assign:function(e,t){for(var a,n,o=function(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Object.assign cannot be called with null or undefined");return Object(e)}(e),r=1;r<arguments.length;r++){for(var i in a=Object(arguments[r]))l.call(a,i)&&(o[i]=a[i]);if(s){n=s(a);for(var u=0;u<n.length;u++)c.call(a,n[u])&&(o[n[u]]=a[n[u]])}}return o},h="function"==typeof Symbol&&Symbol.for,d=h?Symbol.for("react.element"):60103,p=h?Symbol.for("react.portal"):60106,m=h?Symbol.for("react.fragment"):60107,f=h?Symbol.for("react.strict_mode"):60108,g=h?Symbol.for("react.profiler"):60114,y=h?Symbol.for("react.provider"):60109,b=h?Symbol.for("react.context"):60110,v=h?Symbol.for("react.forward_ref"):60112,w=h?Symbol.for("react.suspense"):60113,k=h?Symbol.for("react.suspense_list"):60120,S=h?Symbol.for("react.memo"):60115,T=h?Symbol.for("react.lazy"):60116;h&&Symbol.for("react.fundamental"),h&&Symbol.for("react.responder");var C="function"==typeof Symbol&&Symbol.iterator;function x(e){for(var t=e.message,a="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant="+t,n=1;n<arguments.length;n++)a+="&args[]="+encodeURIComponent(arguments[n]);return e.message="Minified React error #"+t+"; visit "+a+" for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.

You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as \"stunned for 1 minute.\" In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.  \r\n Stunned overrides slowed. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn."},{name:"Stupefied",description:"Your thoughts and instincts are clouded.

Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the control weather ritual (Core Rulebook 411), with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.  \r\nIf a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a coven member brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells."},{name:"Engulf",action:"2",description:"The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path.

You can always move more slowly while Searching to cover the area more thoroughly, and the Expedition Search feat increases these maximum Speeds.
