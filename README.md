# Pathfinder 2E Spell DB

This was created for my own personal use - if you have some fun with it that's great!

It allows you to search & find spells and powers across different classes quickly and easily.

# Credit
[Paizo](http://www.paizo.com) as the makers of Pathfinder are ultimately the source of all the information in this application.

Also used a lot of tech libraries to make this work. I believe all remaining ones exist as node dependencies. Too many to list, but they're all in packages.json.

# Licensing?
I'm not a lawyer, I'm acting on a belief the data itself is licensed under the OGL (See license).

Anything that I have the rights to (presumably some of my code) I'm happy to offer under the MIT license, but I don't want to work out where that line goes.

If anyone from Paizo is looking I hope you don't mind. I believe I'm within the bounds of the OGL & community use licenses. Any request from Paizo regarding the usage of their content (up to and including removing this app) I'll comply with - even if it's not legally binding.
